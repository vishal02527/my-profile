          <h1>Introduction to Programmer vs Coder</h1>
          <p class="para">
            Today’s IT field has expanded to different streams and introduced
            various technical terms. But there is still confusion among the
            Recruiters and other Tech people about certain terminology. One of
            them is the programmer and coder. Though they are used synonymously
            in various cases, they are different. Are you also the one wondering
            what the difference between a programmer and a coder is? Then you
            are in the right place. Here in this article, you will get to know
            the meaning, characteristics, and differences between a programmer
            and a coder. Okay without ado, let’s start the article: programmer
            vs coder.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aloneDiv">
          <h1>Who is a Coder?</h1>
          <p class="para">
            In general, the coder is considered to be a person who writes the
            code. Coders are the least trained or beginners in the engineering
            or programming industry. To get a clear understanding you should
            first know what is coding– Coding is just a translation of a natural
            language into a machine language through an intermediary computer
            language. It is a process of writing codes from one language to
            another. There is no pre-preparation work or trial error in coding.
            A coder will be less experienced and will know only one or two code
            or programming languages. Often Junior programmers, Interns are
            considered to be coders. They are just asked to write the codes that
            are pre-designed or which don’t need any algorithmic knowledge. But
            truth to be told, you won’t be seeing coder job recruitment
            nowadays. In the past coders were involved in converting the unique
            styles or logic into computer language (C or C++), but now it has
            become a thing that every student can do. So the term coder has now
            only been in use only between the non-tech-savvy peoples.

          <h1>Who is a Programmer?</h1>
          <p class="para">
            The programmers are more experienced than a coder, they have wide
            knowledge about different coding or computer languages. They apply
            algorithmic knowledge to create functional software. Let’s see what
            is programming – Programming is the process of commanding or
            instructing the computer on how to perform a particular task.
            Through programming, you can control the various activities of your
            computer. You can write a program in different languages.
            Programming involves various processes like planning, designing,
            testing, deploying and maintaining, etc… Programming is a part of
            Software Engineering itself. A Programmer will be experienced in
            different languages and will create a program to execute a
            particular task. Thus programming involves coding as well as
            structures, algorithms, and more complex concepts. Sometimes the
            Programmer is recruited in different titles like Software Developer,
            Junior Engineer, etc…
